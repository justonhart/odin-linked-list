# Odin Linked List
This project is part of the Odin Project, a self-driven web development training program. Learn more at [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/).

## Project summary
The assignment for this project was to implement LinkedList using JavaScript. I prefer TypeScript so I used that instead. I used Jest to test my implementation, and everything seems to work as specified. I opted not complete the "extra-credit" methods for this project because there was an undefined case for the _insertAt_ function wherein the provided index is greater than the list size.
